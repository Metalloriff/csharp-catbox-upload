# csharp-catbox-upload
A very basic wrapper for uploading files to catbox.moe anonymously with no extra libraries.

I couldn't find examples of this anywhere online, so I uploaded the single file to GitHub for anyone else looking for this. Currently, the only functionality is uploading files anonymously, as that's what I was trying to achieve, but I may create a full C# library in the future.

This is just a lazy port from my Unity project. Obviously feel free to move this function into any of your pre-existing classes.
